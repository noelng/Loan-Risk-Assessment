# Loan-Risk-Assessment

Loan risk assessment is a critical task in the lending industry. It involves evaluating the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan, and assigning a risk score based on their creditworthiness, financial history, and other relevant factors. The risk score helps lenders determine whether to approve the loan, and at what interest rate. However, accurately assessing loan risk is a complex and challenging task, requiring the analysis of large amounts of data, including credit reports, financial statements, and loan repayment histories. In this problem, we aim to use machine learning to build a loan risk model that can accurately predict the risk of default for new loan applications. By doing so, we can help lenders make more informed decisions about which loans to approve, and at what terms, ultimately reducing their overall risk exposure and improving their bottom line.
